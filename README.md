# IMLAB
IMLAB is an image processing system based on TNRD developed by MATLAB.   
Here is how to use the codes:   
(1).Download all zip files, and decompress all of them.   
(2).Confirm that you see 'GaussianDenoising', 'JPEGdeblocking' and 'SuperResolution' in 'Testcodes(denoising-deblocking-SR)'.   
(3).Put all the '.mat' files of 'TrainModels4Deblocking' into the 'JPEGdeblocking' folder.   
(4).Put all the '.mat' files of 'TrainingModels4GaussianDenoising5' and 'TrainingModels4GaussianDenoising79' into the 'GaussianDenoising' folder.   
(5).Put all the '.mat' files of 'TrainingModels4SuperResolution' into the 'SuperResolution' folder.   
(6).Find 'TNRD.m' in 'IMLABCodes' and open it with MATLAB.   
(7).Try to run the 'TNRD.m', and you will see a GUI.   
(8).Good luck!   
   
notes: Use windows OS to run TNRD.m.
